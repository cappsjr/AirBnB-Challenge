#The most expensive listing is $7,700, and it is for a night in a private room in a place named Habitacion Moncloa - Aravaca Arguelles.  
#It is located in a neighborhood group called Moncloa-Aravaca in a neighborhood called Arguelles.  
#The host of the property is listed as Hector.  Its popularity is difficult to determine because it has no reviews.  
#There is a column in the dataset labeled “availability_365,” which lists this property as available 364 days, 
#but I cannot determine whether this means that the public has the ability to rent it 364 out of 365 days a year 
#or whether this means that it was only rendered unavailable by a renter one day out of the 365-day calendar year.  
#Depending on the meaning of the column, it could shed more light on the popularity of the this particular listing.

#What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

#I used this SQL query to find the average availability for each neighborhood and then order by ascending availability.  
#The reason I chose to do this was that I assumed that the most popular neighborhoods would have the least amount of availability 
#because they would be booked more often than the less popular neighborhoods.  Based on this query, the five most popular neighborhoods are
#as follows: 1) Corralejos (avg. availability = 108), 2) Orcasitas (120), 3) Orcasur (126.375), 4) San Andres (129.428571428571), and 
#5) Arcos (131.722222222222).
